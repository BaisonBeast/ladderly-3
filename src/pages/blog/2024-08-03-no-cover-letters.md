title: "15. On Cover Letters and Resume Tailoring"

Ladderly.io's general advice is that software engineers should not spend time and effort on writing cover letters or tailoring their resume. This article provides additional data behind that general recommendation, plus additional nuance which includes identifying some edge cases in which such actions would become a good idea.

## Common Wisdom

Common wisdom holds that tailoring your resume will lead to increased response rates. [This LinkedIn poll](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-size-fits-all-vs-custom-fitted-resumes-which-get-you-anderson/) (n=938) from Chris Anderson in 2021 documented this popular advice. 56 percent of respondents affirmed that "one or two" tailored resumes would "get better results" than "a large number of generic resumes." Here are a few problems with this analysis:

1. "Better results" is ambiguous and mathematically falsifiable under some assumptions about what constitutes "a large number of generic resumes."
   1. Imagine that a tailored resume performs ten times as well as a generic resume. Then, the generic resume would get more callbacks and job offers with as few as eleven applications, ceteris paribus.
   2. While some job seekers might consider ten or twenty applications to be "a large number," this would not be the normal usage in statistical work, where large would imply at least one hundred.
2. The term "generic" has a stigma, which will repel poll votes for psychological and behavioral reasons independent of real resume performance.
   1. Social acceptability bias exacerbates this effect when polls are not anonymous, as in the case of a LinkedIn poll.
   2. Psycho-social biases are further exacerbated on LinkedIn due to echo chamber effects. Respondents tend to be members of the network of the poll creator rather than the general public, and social networks tend to share opinions and desire to affirm one another, so stigma response will be doubly problematic in LinkedIn polls.
3. This advice is not specific to software engineers or the technology industry, and application norms vary significantly by industry.

To get a slightly better read on this with respect to software engineers, [I ran my own poll](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-vandivier_which-approach-is-likely-to-generate-more-activity-7225517862566670336-IX3L/) with more precise wording, asking:

> Which approach is likely to generate more interviews for software engineers (and nearby roles like web developer, full stack developer, data engineer and so on)? Which application approach will likely generate more interviews? 100 apps tailored per role or 10 apps tailored per job post?

This poll is more useful for the Ladderly.io audience for four reasons:

1. It is specific to software engineering and similar roles.
2. The quantities are concrete, resulting in a debiasing effect and also more useful quantitative interpretation.
3. This poll avoids stigmatic language.
4. This poll is more recently, notably existing after the use of AI for tailoring has become common.

### TODO: ADD RESULTS HERE

In summary, common wisdom holds that tailoring is not merely beneficial, but it is a multiplier technique rather than an incremental improvement. The prediction from common wisdom is that time spent on tailoring has a better return on investment compared to allocating that same time toward a second application.

Problems with these results include:

1. They are all based on polling, not observational study of actual job search data or research.
2. Guidance on how to tailor varies widely, and estimates of the value of tailoring do not account for the quality of tailoring.
3.

## Existing Research

## An Original Contribution

John Vandivier is the founder and lead maintainer of Ladderly.io and in 2024 he conducted a job search from May through early August. He censored and open sourced his job search data here, and it provides useful insight into the question of the return on investment to resume optimization compared to other activities.

TODO (I think no significant connection between resume and rate of interview)

A caveat in this data is that even the earliest version of the resume could be describe as fair in quality, without obvious grammatical errors or similar issues. So the fact that the variation in resume version did not correlate with outcomes does not mean that resume quality has no impact, but it does mean that once you have a fairly high quality resume, fine-tuning it into an ultra-high quality resume has negligible return, which is exactly applicable to the discussion of whether a resume should be optimized per job post or simply at the level of the job family or role.

## Edge Cases

When you have a singular target role or company, fine-tuning your resume to that role or company makes sense. While social networking will have a greater impact, you can do both. In generally, Ladderly.io recommends against targeting a specific company for most people. Such a strategy increases timeline for the job search and generally reduces potential compensation by eliminating the ability to obtain competing offers.

Still, there is an exceptional case where tailoring does make sense. This is the case when a job candidate intends to fully exhaust the market of potential employers. If a candidate has a timeline which can support applying to every employer of interest with additional time remaining, it makes sense to invest such additional time into improving the odds of success for that given pool of employers.

Here are a few such cases which might motivate an individual without respect to timeline, compensation, or risk:

1. An individuals is interested in an ultra-niche technologies, skills, activities, or causes.
2. An individual is already paid top-of-market, so only a few companies could potentially support an increase in desired compensation.
3. An individual is restricted for geopolitical or other reasons to work with a small market of potential employers.
4. An individual is attracted to a particular brand or working with specific people that occupy specific companies.
