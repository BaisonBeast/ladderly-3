GitHub now has an early preview a
powerful but simple feature keyboard
shortcuts command K and then you can up
and down arrow to navigate the menu
without leaving your keyboard here I
began to type token you can see it can
give me three levels deep in the menu in
a much more efficient manner

Title: Artists can Code
Description: None
Transcript:
here's my result from the rising test
the interesting here is that my top
scores are artistic and social and I'm a
programmer so I hope this helps to break
the stereotype that programming is like
just for I don't know boring people or
something

Title: Solving Problems is the Core Skill
Description: None
Transcript:
video says it's not about JavaScript
view reacts felt or the latest fancy
framework it's about the problems you
solve how you solve them how long does
it take you to solve them hard to
disagree I don't know if this is like
feel good content or what but if you're
trying to actually land a job
scientifically prefer react to spell for
example

Title: Remix isn’t cool
Description: None
Transcript:
react remix is a react framework that's
been around for a year but it's been
under a license now it's open source
it's causing a bit of a splash so do I
recommend you learn it the answer is no
and fireship sums up my reason right
here it only does SSR not the other
render types

Title: Coding Bootcamps and Gender Diversity
Description: None
Transcript:
why do we have high levels of gender
diversity in coding boot camps but we
don't have high levels in computer
science programs I'm currently analyzing
novel data one early finding is that
women desire a programming career at
about the same rate that men do so maybe
CS curriculum is the problem instead of
the occupation itself

Title: How to Factor Bias out of Data
Description: None
Transcript:
Bart Barkley Nas how do we Factor biases
out of our data great question here are
three answers so the first answer is
that you constrain your interpretation
so let's say that I want to survey all
Americans and I want to know how they
think about the latest movie I put a
survey online oops what I didn't realize
where I put the survey people can only
create an account if they're age 18 or
older so now I've biased my survey
results to U.S adults rather than the
whole US population one easy thing to do
is just re-interpret the result don't
claim that you're surveying all
Americans just say this is the result
for U.S adults
the second approach is to modify your
data by modify data we mean AD samples
remove samples add variables or remove
variables depending on certain
analytical conditions any of those might
be ideal in the specific case where we
unintentionally just surveyed adults and
we really wanted the opinions of the
whole population the obvious thing to do
here would be to specifically survey
those under the age of 18 merge those
data sets and now we hopefully have a
representative data set in the age
example adults would be called one
strata and kids or those under the age
of 18 would be another strata or
subgroup so having some samples in each
strata is not quite good enough to
ensure a representative result you
either need to have a large number of
responses in each strata or a
proportional number of results in each
strata if you don't have either of those
you can still make a estimate if you use
a specific analytical model that
accounts for heteroskedasticity
so that would not be any statistical
approach you need to be smart about
which one you pick but you can still get
a result it will just be like a much
lower confidence result because if you
interpret incorrectly or if you use the
wrong interpretive model you will be
over waiting
um a particular group's voice compared
to the general population how many
samples is a large number um so we
usually say the law of large numbers
kicks in over 100 samples so the T
distribution converges to the Z
distribution it's like a technical uh
statistical thing
uh and really you want to have like at
least 30 samples and then preferably
over 100. under that you can still get a
result it will just be a really low
confidence result recommendation three
is use multiple analytical approaches
whether or not your data is biased
having multiple analytical approaches
ensures a robust result which is really
really great it's going to give you more
evidence for your causal theories it's
going to be better for predictive
performance it's really really great so
ordinaryly squares is like pretty basic
difference in means test pretty basic a
lasso is really good for feature
selection elastic net also Vector
regression these are some good things
you can check the p-value I like to look
for a p-value under 0.5 which logically
indicates that it's more likely that the
effect is different from zero than that
it's equal to zero so we're never really
certain with Statistics but if five
models say the sky is blue it's good
evidence

Title: is js a good language...?
Description: None
Transcript:
unique excuse me Js is a good language
JavaScript is a great language
it can be misleading what are you
talking about hold on gas is weird.com
clearly documents all of the great
things JavaScript does that other
programming languages wish they could do
so it doesn't need to be misleading just
go study like for example true plus
false what do you think it is or
Exclamation point Exclamation point
Exclamation point true you don't get mad
when we do this in English when we say
something and then we put like three
exclamation points why are you mad at
JavaScript that we're doing this English
is great do you hate English I mean even
in English we know there's a big
difference between when something is
true and when it's literally true in
quotes right duh they're not the same
thing duh JavaScript is just reflecting
our shared reality
JavaScript is so great you can divide by
zero Hey mathematicians jealous much so
anyway I'd appreciate it if you just
take the word JavaScript and put some
respect on the name you know
