why do we have high levels of gender

Title: How to Factor Bias out of Data
Description: None
Transcript:
Bart Barkley Nas how do we Factor biases
out of our data great question here are
three answers so the first answer is
that you constrain your interpretation
so let's say that I want to survey all
Americans and I want to know how they
think about the latest movie I put a
survey online oops what I didn't realize
where I put the survey people can only
create an account if they're age 18 or
older so now I've biased my survey
results to U.S adults rather than the
whole US population one easy thing to do
is just re-interpret the result don't
claim that you're surveying all
Americans just say this is the result
for U.S adults
the second approach is to modify your
data by modify data we mean AD samples
remove samples add variables or remove
variables depending on certain
analytical conditions any of those might
be ideal in the specific case where we
unintentionally just surveyed adults and
we really wanted the opinions of the
whole population the obvious thing to do
here would be to specifically survey
those under the age of 18 merge those
data sets and now we hopefully have a
representative data set in the age
example adults would be called one
strata and kids or those under the age
of 18 would be another strata or
subgroup so having some samples in each
strata is not quite good enough to
ensure a representative result you
either need to have a large number of
responses in each strata or a
proportional number of results in each
strata if you don't have either of those
you can still make a estimate if you use
a specific analytical model that
accounts for heteroskedasticity
so that would not be any statistical
approach you need to be smart about
which one you pick but you can still get
a result it will just be like a much
lower confidence result because if you
interpret incorrectly or if you use the
wrong interpretive model you will be
over waiting
um a particular group's voice compared
to the general population how many
samples is a large number um so we
usually say the law of large numbers
kicks in over 100 samples so the T
distribution converges to the Z
distribution it's like a technical uh
statistical thing
uh and really you want to have like at
least 30 samples and then preferably
over 100. under that you can still get a
result it will just be a really low
confidence result recommendation three
is use multiple analytical approaches
whether or not your data is biased
having multiple analytical approaches
ensures a robust result which is really
really great it's going to give you more
evidence for your causal theories it's
going to be better for predictive
performance it's really really great so
ordinaryly squares is like pretty basic
difference in means test pretty basic a
lasso is really good for feature
selection elastic net also Vector
regression these are some good things
you can check the p-value I like to look
for a p-value under 0.5 which logically
indicates that it's more likely that the
effect is different from zero than that
it's equal to zero so we're never really
certain with Statistics but if five
models say the sky is blue it's good
evidence

Title: Economics to Programming Transition
Description: None
Transcript:
thanks for the question there's a few
ways to answer this question one way is
just you do the normal way forget that
you're an economist and you learn to
code like everybody else
in that case I learned I recommend you
learn HTML CSS JavaScript and react then
maybe typescript if you go that way
you'll probably be able to start coding
as your job in like six months building
websites I'm not sure are you American
citizen because that is going to impact
how much you can get paid and things
like that in US you would probably make
like at least 60 Grand doing that now if
you are an economist then there are some
more interesting things you could do the
question is how much experience do you
have and do you have a background in
statistics so if you're an economist
with couple years of experience I'm
expecting you can do statistics with at
least Excel if not stata or SPSS and
hopefully you have some data
visualization skills maybe you know
Tableau for example in this case
learning python would be a smart idea
for you you can probably even use python
in your current role for statistics then
you can also get a data engineering role
if you want to make a slow and steady
transition you could get a job as a
business analyst

so it doesn't need to be misleading just
go study like for example true plus
false what do you think it is or
Exclamation point Exclamation point
Exclamation point true you don't get mad
when we do this in English when we say
something and then we put like three
exclamation points why are you mad at
JavaScript that we're doing this English
is great do you hate English I mean even
in English we know there's a big
difference between when something is
true and when it's literally true in
quotes right duh they're not the same
thing duh JavaScript is just reflecting
our shared reality
JavaScript is so great you can divide by

Title: How Much Data Bias is Acceptable?
Description: None
Transcript:
Jordan wonderful question what amount of
data bias do you think is acceptable so
for the general audience let me take a
step back and Define what we even mean
by bias bias here we're using a
technical sense in terms of statistical
bias in ordinary English a bias might
refer to a tendency John you're always
doing economic analysis are you biased
towards economics and statistics that
would be called a correlation or a
tendency that in and of itself is not a
bias a bias would be if your correlation
was higher than it should be or lower
than it should be if your measurement of
correlation was incorrect or erroneous
it would be biased but the correlation
by itself totally fine in the technical
sense here's another way that bias would
basically not be acceptable and it's
also not the technical definition of ice
hey John we know that you have this
conclusion that you already have in your
mind and you're trying to sneak it in
and you're just trying to put a veneer
of Statistics over the top so in
economics we would call that a moral
hazard and that's distinct from a
technical bias although in the normal
English we kind of say hey you're biased
and we're actually referring to that
moral hazard so here are two examples of
technical bias one would be omitted
variable bias say I'm doing a regression
between gender in the tech industry and
I just do a simple regression one-on-one
univariate regression but there's
actually a bunch of other things that
matter like for example personality or
risk aversion
um so if I leave those variables out if
I omit them then the statistical
coefficient of gender will be biased
because it will be including some of
those other effects that shouldn't be
attributed to it another important
technical bias is repeated measurement
bias where if I run a survey on Monday
Tuesday and Wednesday and I get 50
responses each day and then I do a
regression on them and I don't account
for the fact that Jim responded on all
three days and he actually got more
votes as it were
um then there's a bias where I'm
actually over representing Jim's opinion
and I'm not really getting the opinion
of the general population so that would
be a biased result so those are formal
statistical biases there are also
informal or domain-specific biases and
economics this would include anti-market
bias anti-innovation bias anti-foreign
bias self-similarity bias
so these are biases that are results of
theories in your field and those biases
are not statistical biases in the sense
that your model is technically wrong
what they mean is that there's a
disproportionate impact between the
expected result and The observed result
so if I give somebody ten dollars and I
observe how they spend it I'm gonna
there's gonna be a systematic difference
compared to if I just ask them by survey
by questionnaire hey how would you spend
ten dollars in economics we've observed
that there's a theoretical bias there
and specifically people respond by
questionnaire that they're much more
willing to spend money
um than they in fact are When You
observe them with their cash in their
wallet so with all that background
there's situations in which an optimal
decision uses 100 biased data follow for
part two I'll give you a specific
example much more to talk about

for you out of the box in an opinionated
way Blitz is a framework on top of

Blitz is that it uses react query as
opposed to Redux for State Management
and uh like caching and HTTP requests
and stuff like that Blitz also includes
Prisma and typescript out of the box so
here's the website check it out at the
top we can see flight control that's
another thing to mention Blitz has its
own infrastructure that is purpose built
to host Blitz that's a work in progress
but it's called flight control it's
going to be sort of like versel or
Railway but specifically for Blitz and
at the bottom we can see import Zod so
that's another thing to mention so uh
Blitz is also opinionated about your

HR says I'll get back to you the
candidate says when just ghosts two tips
for you getting feedback from HR after
your interview first hold them
accountable make sure during the
interview they tell you or you ask when
am I going to hear back from you then
follow up on their timeline you're not
pestering them you're in the driver's
seat now you're holding them accountable
for what they told you they would do
second rule is three weeks three days if
your interview was on a Friday don't
follow up on a Monday give them at least
three business days and in addition to a
three business day space between emails
one email a week is a good Pace don't do
more than that unless you have a special
reason like they told you to
specifically with that pace of
communication in mind if I haven't heard
from you on the third week I'm moving on
my job search should not be all about
One employer specifically if my
interview is on a Tuesday and I haven't
heard from you by the next or the next
Tuesday sure I'll fire out one more
email but I'm moving on so I teach
people to code and land their first
programming job if you're interested
follow my page this advice is somewhat
tailored to such a candidate who's doing
a large volume of applications needs to
be judicious with their time

Description: None
Transcript:
in today's market the companies need you
more than you need them great point from
Fong let me build on that with three
more strategies that will help you
relieve stress combat anxiety coming up
to and through an interview overall
strategy here is to make the interview
be a good thing now that it's a good
thing you want it to happen you're
excited instead of this risky thing that
you currently perceive it is that's
triggering your anxiety number one a
bunch of people are worried about in
this interview I'm going to meet people
I've never met before how is my first
impression going to be isn't that risky
actually it's a great social networking
opportunity however the interview goes
always finish up with something like
this I've had a great time here it was a
pleasure to meet you regardless of how
this turns out I'd love to connect with
you on LinkedIn do each and every
interview is an opportunity to practice
this unique skill of interviewing so
whether or not they extend an offer you
gained value just by going through the
motions if you screwed up a question you
got a great diagnostic on exactly what
to practice three job searches and
numbers games so whether this company
makes an offer or not don't stress about
that you do enough of these from a
probability standpoint you're gonna get
a job

Title: 4 Ways to Collect Data
Description: None
Transcript:
Bart barklington asks where do we find
raw data how do we know how it was
collected and how do we know if that
data is biased great questions follow
for a commentary on bias here I'll focus
on data collection I would suggest four
ways first is original data curation or
collection you can use just a picture
turn that into pixels that's data record
audio that's data anything sensory that
you can record questionnaires
um I like to use SurveyMonkey and
Mechanical Turk for participant
recruitment so if you collect your own
data you should document that and you
know how it was collected second way is
through public data set search so
searching anything online Google is your
friend there is a specific Google data
set search as well it's really Nifty
ideally the data set comes with
documentation about how it was collected
or there may be an Associated research
paper with a methodology data
description or similar section if you
can't find any of that maybe don't use
the data option three is contact the
researcher who wrote the paper or the
journal where it was published and ask
for a copy of the data option four you
can often purchase data I like statista
for example

Title: Efficient Bias
Description: None
Transcript:
so how much database is acceptable part
two this is the economic answer that's
mathematically rigorous and that would
be you should pay to improve your data
quality until the marginal benefit is
equal to the marginal cost when you
reach that point where they're equal
spending any more money is going to be a
bad return on investment so you should
use that money elsewhere so you
shouldn't spend it further on data
quality we don't have an infinite budget
for data quality right and sometimes our
budget is extremely limited sometimes
our budget constrains us to a sample of
one or even zero so a real example of
this would be like a once in a lifetime
investment opportunity invest now or
you'll never get to invest again
it'd be extremely risky but you still
might go for it
another example would be you're an
employee and like you know you're kind
of on the chopping block let's say
um and it's like you have to make this
high-stakes uh prediction you have to
make it now you're in a boardroom
meeting they're not going to let you go
do more research you have to make a
judgment call right now on the basis of
the information you have
but what if you have no direct samples
of the question you're going to have to
rely on kind of like intuitions or
judgment calls or like related studies
that you think might be related
basically intuition which is arguably
either a sample of one or a sample of
zero so intuition does not have a value
of zero but it's also full of biases
right so the more objective data we can
get the better and there is kind of an
upper limit which is once you have
measured the entire population like
there's not much more
um bias reduction you can do although
you can still possibly improve your
measurement approach so measurement bias
is a thing so even if you've measured
the entire population of samples
if you measured it wrong you have a
measurement bias so there are still
opportunities to improve or if you've
analyzed it you could have an analytical
bias or a model bias
so these are places where you can spend
more time and effort to improve your
measurement process your modeling
process your analytical process
but whether we're talking about time or
whether we're talking about dollars
you're having to spend right and we're
constrained on all these fronts the last
thing I would say here is that when we
talk about the marginal benefit and the
marginal cost costs and benefits are
both subjective so in economics We Care
not just about dollars we're not Finance
guys we're not accountants we're
economists right we're higher than that
we're better
so we care about subjective value and
utility
so if your employee base at your company
is sort of emotionally invested like
they're really personally interested in
a diversity initiative you're going to
want to count that as an additional
benefit to investing in diversity right
and you can actually capture this if you
dig in and measure it properly there
will be benefits to retention and
employee satisfaction and so forth so be
sure that you're counting those what we
call non-pecuniary or non-dollar
benefits as well on both the cost side
and the benefit side and don't forget
opportunity cost don't forget that one
right I wouldn't be an economist if I
didn't mention that too
sum it all up one more time invest until
MB equals MC

today we are reacting to developer

most starved project on GitHub uh where
do you go through it step by step and
compare it to laterally
by the way here's laterally laterally as
an open source learning uh like
educational system
so kind of an alternative to free code
Camp the first impression is that
there's way too much here if someone
asks you hey I'd like to learn to code
what should I do sending them here
would seem to be confusing what I would
prefer instead is right out of the gate
it should suggest a path I recommend you
learn react not Python and that is a
stepping stone towards becoming a full

Title: Css turkey #lol
Description: None
Transcript:
I want to make a relevant addition to my
web portfolio and it's Thanksgiving so
let's make a turkey as a web developer I
know that a turkey will be drawn with
HTML and CSS so I Google CSS turkey I
found a few results and checked them out
but I'm really happy with the top result
so this is what it looks like so I copy
it and I put it in my GitHub portfolio
and deploy it to GitHub Pages at this
point it's basically someone else's work
which is not really a plagiarism issue
in programming it's just that it doesn't
demonstrate any of my skill so how can I
change this turkey this collection of
HTML elements in a way that demonstrates
my skill well I think the tips of the
feathers can change colors so I'll make
that Dynamic and add some JavaScript you
can't see it in this picture but the
eyes are doing this weird googly thing
I'll take that away because it's
annoying and then I can also add some
audio so when you click it I'll make it
squawk so here's the final result I live
coded the whole thing I'll put a link to
this and a link to the YouTube video in
the comments be sure to follow my page
if you want to learn to code you can
totally do it drop a comment if there's
anything I can answer for you

Description: None
Transcript:
thanks Josh this guy gets it so
JavaScript is so great JavaScript
JavaScript JavaScript if you say three
times fast and click your heels an
infinite Loop appears you can't do that
with other programming languages Let me
give you three more reasons in addition
to my bulletproof argument from the last
video why JavaScript is so great first
of all it's the most popular programming
languages everyone knows it yeah I
realize it's not really taught in
computer science programs why do you
think because the professors were never
popular they were like nerds they don't
want you to be popular so they teach you
stuff that's not popular reason number
two it's used in the browsers in all of
the websites do you use websites I use
websites websites are great everyone
knows that websites are things that we
use so I don't know exactly who decided
that JavaScript would be used there I
just kind of have a trust that whatever
decision criteria they had it was real
it was perfect like what could be wrong
with that because we all use it
therefore it's great so thanks

micro size startup that went under I've
been one of a few in a small mid-sized
company that was acquired the ability to
personally make a Major Impact at a
small firm is real you can influence
major decisions and be credited for
thousands of percents of increase in
technical metrics go zero to one in
Peter Thiel terminology but you can also
be held liable for a failure to produce
right so can you make a bigger social
contribution through a major Tech firm
compared to a small company the answer
is absolutely yes so think about the
total addressable Market suppose that
you increase user Happiness by 0.5
percent over millions over billions of
users that could easily beat a small
company 10xing the other approach is to
make bank and give to charity and

Title: Modified TDD is Best TDD
Description: None
Transcript:
I want to create a new component react
but I want to do tdd so I start by
making a unit test that references a
component that doesn't exist fails stub
the file and now the test passes I just
made a tdd increment and I also just
wasted a bunch of time but let's not
stop there because every time that I do
a new commit I need my test to pass
right I don't realize that there are
these like patterns and conventions
embedded in other components how do I
make an HTTP call what variables do I
name how should I name my ID that I'm
referencing uh used ref on the component
so every time I write a test for these
things I am assuming implementation and
then that implementation turns out not
to be correct so I have to refactor the
component and the unit test doubling my
LOE instead here's what I do I create
the component and then I create the test
and I just make sure everything works
before I submit a PR at the end the
result is the same you have a set of
unit tests that pass but it's a lot less
LOE in the middle so this is a modified
tdd pattern that I suggest for
Developers

Title: Python for DevOps?
Description: None
Transcript:
this user says python for devops I agree
but it's not really clear-cut let me
give you a few reasons why core skills
and devops are going to be Docker and
Bash and also infrastructure setting up
infrastructure in some Cloud environment
often AWS if you have those many
companies don't care what programming
language you have a background in but
they do care that you have some
programming background so I don't think
any Juniors should be going directly
into devops it's really hard to
understand what's going on if you have
no technical background so devops I see
is an intermediate to senior plus role
where usually you have some Junior
experience programming something
here you can see devops engineer it is a
specialty so the job count is kind of
low look at this top result here's the
skills for the top result willing to do
the job and learn they specify
Technologies like Docker and AWS
infrastructure but they don't specify a
language it's really common not to
specify a language for devops I went
through the top 10 on indeed four
specified some languages one was only
JavaScript three were like python or
Ruby or Java

Title: Why Frontend Programming?
Description: None
Transcript:
I specialize in teaching people how to
break an attack and learn how to code
follow my page if you're interested this
commenter asks why I recommend front-end
programming to that end great question a
bunch of reasons I'll give you three
first the mental model of a website what
a good website looks like is really
familiar to even non-technical people
the main four branches of programming
are front-end back-end devops and data
analysis data analysis is kind of
intuitive but devops is like totally
foreign to the normal person if you say
infrastructure they're thinking about
like their house and then back end is
really abstract and hard to visualize if
you're not trained in thinking that way
so building on that point too the
alternatives to front end requires
special training so you're not going to
be a good data analysis you could
actually be a little bit dangerous if
you're a data analyst that doesn't know
stats for example three is the level of
difficulty of setup with front-end
programming you already probably have
the Chrome browser installed and you can
get started sandbox in the Chrome Dev
tools and you can also visit like
w3schools and code in your browser other
languages are growing and your ability
to have like an in-browser experience
but tools are rough outside of front end

Title: Java vs JavaScript
Description: None
Transcript:
Alex thanks for the question there are a
ton of differences I'll just give you
three and before I start let me say that
this is one of those brightline tests
that programmers use to determine
whether or not you're like a programmer
or not so non-technical folks get this
mixed up all the time another one of
these brightline tests would be saying
HTML is a programming language which
it's not so HTML stands for hypertext
markup language so it's a language right
and it's a language used by programs
therefore it's a programming language
right actually no and so that's
something that a lot of non-technical
people think but programmers know it's
not touring complete so it's not what we
mean when we say that we're writing
programs we can't use it anyway three
main differences Java is strongly typed
it is pre-compiled often manually
compiled and it is a server-side
language in contrast JavaScript is
dynamically typed it is just in time
compiled and it runs full stack on the
server and in the browser it's notable
that it's the only programming language
used in websites

to get my life perfect before I can
learn no start with the thing that you
want to learn it might end up being
really easy you might be able to knock
it out without making any big life
changes if you do need to change your
life

start by starting to learn today and you
can work on yourself later so what do
you want to learn you want to learn
whatever is going to maximize your
return on investment for time and effort
for a lot of people that's learning to
code this can unlock a high paying
remote career and you can do this with
Alternative Learning you don't
necessarily need a college degree so if
you're going to learn to code what
curriculum you need an evidenced based
curriculum that means something that's
Project based it's going to be full
stack that's going to unlock the
majority of programming jobs if you're
looking at a coding boot camp in
particular check out course report 4.25
or higher rating with a minimum of 400
