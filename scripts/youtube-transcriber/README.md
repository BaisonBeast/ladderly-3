don't forget! tasks.py has your invoke tasks 👍👍

## installation

`poetry install`

## ide compliance

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry shell
which python
```

then cmd+shift+p -> "Select Python Interpreter" and give VS Code the path identified via `which python`
if you are on windows, don't paste the bash path literal. you should translate that location into Windows syntax
