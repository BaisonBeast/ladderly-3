Blitz comes with a test setup using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/).

### Built With

1. [**Blitz.js**](https://blitzjs.com)
2. **ESLint**: It lints your code: searches for bad practices and tell you about it. You can customize it via the `.eslintrc.js`, and you can install (or even write) plugins to have it the way you like it. It already comes with the [`blitz`](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/canary/packages/eslint-config) config, but you can remove it safely. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/eslint-config).
3. **Husky**: It adds [githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks), little pieces of code that get executed when certain Git events are triggerd. For example, `pre-commit` is triggered just before a commit is created. You can see the current hooks inside `.husky/`. If are having problems commiting and pushing, check out ther [troubleshooting](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=troubleshoot) guide. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/husky-config).
4. **Prettier**: It formats your code to look the same everywhere. You can configure it via the `.prettierrc` file. The `.prettierignore` contains the files that should be ignored by Prettier; useful when you have large files or when you want to keep a custom formatting. [Learn More](https://blitzjs.com/docs/prettier-config).
